I am calling in regards to rate expiration We've been trying to reach you as your eligibility for rate reduction is about to expire Press one for more information or hang up this call Thanks for holding the line nervous you're doing fine That's great sir. Nice to hear that and I believe that you are responding to get all over rates in the credit card, right? Right All right, it's enough for the qualification. I just want to make sure when does your card is going to be expired? What's the expiration date on it? I have several cards. Now, you said you were with Discover? Yes, we are We are So, are you referring to my Discover card? Yes, sir Are you going to get me a new Discover card? No, I'm going to give you a lower interest rate on all of the credit card, whatever you have It's a Visa, Master or Discover, all right? And here you can see that you are maintaining your payments on time Last six to eight months and you never miss your payments. In fact, most of the time you try to pay more than the minimum payments, correct? Right All righty, so that's the only one reason today you are perfectly qualified to get a lower rate and the current interest rate you're getting charged It's more than ten percent. I believe you know that, correct? Yes All righty, so today you are going to drop down the interest rate less than six percent up to zero and after that you are paying your bills much quicker and much faster. All righty? Okay Okay, so now for the qualification, I just want to make sure which of the credit card do you pay the high interest rate right now and which you have a high balance right now. Which card is that? Well, I don't know. I don't know what the rate is. My Capital One card Capital One, I got you. And when is the Capital One card going to be expired? Can you check out the expiration date on it, the month and the year? It's in 2023 Which month is that? May Okay Okay, and so now I'm going to do, I'm going to pull out the recent billing statement for a year and I will let you know the current balance you owe on that account and the last payment you might have the next minimum payment page and everything from my side and according to that I will let you know what with the interest rate you are going to get on your Capital One MasterCard, all right? Okay All right, so now for the qualification, for the verification you have to reconform with the card number or with the recorded number starting with 5178. Do you have a stamp code you can see the front of the card? Yes Okay, so kindly go ahead and reconform with the card number or with the recorded number from beginning, from five It doesn't start with 5178 So that's your Visa card or it's a MasterCard? It's a Visa card What's a Visa card? Oh, that's a Visa card, all right, so you have to reconform with the card number from four Well, but I can't give my card number out over the phone I got your point, but it's just for the verification, you have to reconform with the card number over the recorded nine I told you, I can't give my number out over the phone, if you have all these records about me All right, all right, okay, I got your point, it's perfectly fine, as a primary card holder you are predicting yourself and I only appreciate it for this, but it's just for the verification, all right So you are not so comfortable to give the card number over the recorded nine? So you have to reconform with only the last four digits of the card number to make sure that you are the primary and authorized man on that account And this card is not picked up or stolen card, all right?
